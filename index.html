   <h1>A Bit About Me</h1>
  <p>
    Before deciding to take this course, I was installing solar panels. While I loved being outside all day and doing something positive for the planet, the lack of mental stimulation took its toll. So when I got laid off due to Corana virus I started to learn Javascript, and enjoyed the challenge enough that I decided to join this course.

    When I'm not struggling to learn to code, I spend my free time highlining, climbing, hiking, skiing, skill toys and drinking beer in beautiful places.
